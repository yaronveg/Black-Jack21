## 🖥 About the game

### 🔧 Tools
The games was built using a combination of HTML, SASS/CSS and JavaScript.
The code was written using VS code.

### 🏃‍♀️ Animation
The flying card animation was done with a combination of CSS keyframes and JS event-listeners.
Every time a card is being dealt, the code calculates trajcetory and passes it to the CSS as a style property.
The animation itself is beaing called in same manner. The CSS then adds a spin around the Z-Axis.

### 🃏 Card design
Card designs were taken from Wikipedia's page for the standard 52-card deck:
